# 8puzzlesolver

Used depth-first and breadth-first traversal to solve an 8-puzzle.  Various data structures were used, with stacks and queues being used primarily to print the solution to the puzzle.

Both input variables for depth-first and breadth-first are an array of integers that indicates the initial-puzzle state, and an int that indicates the number of random moves to be completed before solving it.
